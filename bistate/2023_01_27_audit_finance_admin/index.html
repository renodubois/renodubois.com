<p>Hey y&rsquo;all, quick note from the editor on this one. Financial reports are&mldr;confusing to me as a non-financial person, so these notes aren&rsquo;t the greatest ones I&rsquo;ve put out.
I&rsquo;m hoping to understand more as I get through more meetings, but just a heads up that the first few financial meetings will be a bit harder for me to make useful notes for.
If you&rsquo;ve got any suggestions on what information is actually useful here, or just any comments in general, just <a href=mailto:me@renodubois.com>let me know</a>!</p>

<li>Public comment: none for this meeting</li>
<li>Bi-State Development Operating & Capital Budget
<ul>
<li>Presented by Tammy Fulbright</li>
<li>This is for the budget 2024-2026.</li>
<li>There are a bunch of figures and such that I can&rsquo;t easily share, but this information seems to all be in the <a href=https://www.bistatedev.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/01272023-Audit-Finance-Administration-Committee-Open-Meeting-Materials-January-27-2023.pdf>meeting packet</a> that they provided.</li>
<li>Also, I really don&rsquo;t have a good grasp on a lot of budget things, so sorry in advance if I&rsquo;m writing a bunch of things that don&rsquo;t make sense/aren&rsquo;t relevant!</li>
<li>Our 5-year average annual growth is 1.11%.</li>
<li>My favorite part of these budget presentations is that I forget that Bi-State runs the Arch - so you always get a financial statement of people hanging out at the arch.</li>
<li>If I&rsquo;m reading this correctly, Metro is burning $77M a year. Yeesh.
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s after &ldquo;depreciation and transfers&rdquo;, which may make that seem worse? Unclear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now talking about capital funds, which&mldr;is very confusing. There&rsquo;s some pie charts in the packet if you&rsquo;d like to look at these allocations.</li>
<li>On to questions: and there are none.</li>
<li>Motion to approve, but this has to go to the full board for approval.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Contract: Compensation Study
<ul>
<li>Diana Bentz is presenting here.</li>
<li>This is an annual review of compensation, and a formal review every 3 years.</li>
<li>They&rsquo;re proposing some changes to the system because it&rsquo;s hard to hire people right now, and they want to stay competitive in the market.</li>
<li>&ldquo;multiple ranking technology&rdquo; - lot of buzzwords here, holy wow. &ldquo;management-driven vs consultant driven&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Anyways, this sounds like we&rsquo;re hiring a company to do this research. ~$200K.</li>
<li>Moore asks about the frequency of these reports: once a year for the internal, every 3 years they do a formal review, which is what this is.</li>
<li>Voice vote: it&rsquo;s passed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Internal Audit Follow-Up: Q2 FY2023
<ul>
<li>Next up, Crystal Messner is presenting this point and the next two.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Internal Audit Status Report:
<ul>
<li>nothing to note here</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Internal Audit State Safety Oversight Status Report:
<ul>
<li>Everything was on schedule.</li>
<li>Roach chiming in here to say that some of the audits moving around is helping Bi-State target what they want to work on.</li>
<li>Lots of business-y jargon in this section. Apologies again for not having super useful notes!</li>
<li>Moore asks if the 12 incidents they found was more than usual: Messner says that she doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s indicative of a larger trend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pension Evaluations Update
<ul>
<li>Every year, they get a firm to do an analysis on the pensions. Not too much to note here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Treasurer&rsquo;s Report
<ul>
<li>Talking about how much money Bi-State has in different portfolios.</li>
<li>As mentioned before, these details are in the meeting packet, so be sure to check that out if you want more details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Treasury Safekeeping Quarterly Accounts
<ul>
<li>Back to financial jargon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Financial Statements
<ul>
<li>This is going over the numbers we saw a bit earlier in the presentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procurement Report
<ul>
<li>Talking about more financials.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unscheduled Business: none</li>
<li>CEO Report
<ul>
<li>Metro had a hiring event on Jan 28th.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nothing for the executive discussion.</li>
<li>And adjourned!</li>
</ul>
