No time to start posting things on the blog like the new year.
A friend recently suggested something I love the idea of - listening to an album you haven&amp;rsquo;t listened to before, every day for a month. I&amp;rsquo;m starting a few days late into January, but still excited to get started with this.
We&amp;rsquo;ll see how the frequency of these posts keeps up, but I&amp;rsquo;m planning on posting my thoughts on the albums I listen to here, so prepare for amateur music journalism.</description></item><item><title>mikgazer vol 1 Review</title><link>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/mikgazer-vol-1-review/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/mikgazer-vol-1-review/</guid><description>This is a review for my monthlong Album-a-Day adventure in Jan. 2021. if you want to read the other reviews, check out the original post.
First album of the month is a compilation album, mikgazer vol. 1. This is a collection of shoegaze instrumentals with vocals by none other than everyone&amp;rsquo;s favorite vocaloid, Hatsune Miku. Part of the reason I picked this album was because of the odd pairing of those two things, but it honestly worked super well.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.renodubois.com/links/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.renodubois.com/links/</guid><description>My email: me@renodubois.com

It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that (like many things) coffee is subject to a lot of personal preference. Things I like doing may not be the best for you, so feel free to adjust as needed.
I mostly drink filtered coffee, using a v60, with a preference towards lighter, more acidic roasts. Almost all of the coffee I make at home I take black, but I&amp;rsquo;ll sometimes get oat milk with iced coffee at coffee shops.</description></item></channel></rss>
