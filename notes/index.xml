It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that (like many things) coffee is subject to a lot of personal preference. Things I like doing may not be the best for you, so feel free to adjust as needed.
I mostly drink filtered coffee, using a v60, with a preference towards lighter, more acidic roasts. Almost all of the coffee I make at home I take black, but I&amp;rsquo;ll sometimes get oat milk with iced coffee at coffee shops.</description></item></channel></rss>
