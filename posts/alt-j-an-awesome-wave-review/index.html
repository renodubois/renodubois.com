<p>Like most folks in the mid 2010s, I heard <em>Breezeblocks</em> on my local alt rock radio station
for the first time, and thought &ldquo;what a weird but catchy song&rdquo;. That theme was&mldr;further
explored in the rest of the album that Breezeblocks was on, <em>An Awesome Wave</em>. It was a super
weird album that I found oddly catchy at times. The author of this blog doesn&rsquo;t condone
usage of mind-altering substances, but this seems like a pretty good album to make that happen
with.</p>
<p>The harmonies you hear in the first interlude and dispersed elsewhere in the album
are some of the most provoking I&rsquo;ve heard. It was almost <em>haunting</em>, and also was
weird like the rest of the album. To be clear: weird is not a bad thing here.</p>
<p>The instrumentation is well done - a great blend of electronic and acoustic elements
throughout the whole album. I think they&rsquo;ve done one of the better jobs in this groove
of indie for making the productions sound both organic and electronic at the same time
(I think Sylvan Esso does this really well also) and I appreciated the sounds
that went into that. The vocal performances are also incredibly unique and add a lot
to that blend of styles in the production.</p>
<p>Overall, this was a really cool album that I&rsquo;m going to listen to more. It&rsquo;s a little
weird but that&rsquo;s what makes it so dang cool.</p>
<p><strong>Score</strong>: 7.5/10</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Tracks</strong>: Tesselate, Breezeblocks, Dissolve Me, Matilda</p>
<p><strong>One Recommendation</strong>: You&rsquo;ve probably heard Breezeblocks, so check out <em>Dissolve Me</em>.</p>
