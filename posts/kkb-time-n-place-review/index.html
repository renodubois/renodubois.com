<p>Next up on the docket is Kero Kero Bonito&rsquo;s <em>Time &lsquo;n&rsquo; Place</em>: a really
nice, short album that tones down the bright and cheery electronic elements
you heard in earlier KKB records and trades it in for guitars and the
occasional bit of noise. I had only listened to a bit of KKB before this,
and I was expecting more dancy electropop that I heard from them previously,
but this album took a different direction that I really liked. The inclusion
of glitched out vocals, bursts of noise, and the recurring themes of dreams
and looking back at your life really instilled this dream-like quality over
the whole record.</p>
<p>Dream-like doesn&rsquo;t mean all rainbows in this case, though -
especially when songs like &ldquo;Make Believe&rdquo; touch on how dreams can turn into
very real anxiety when you wake up from them. The song &ldquo;Only Acting&rdquo; was a big
favorite for me on the record - it&rsquo;s got a super catchy groove before devolving
into a glitched out mess at the end, after realizing that a stage persona is bleeding
into real life more than intended. It&rsquo;s an unexpected ending, but I really like it,
and after listening a few times, it&rsquo;s probably one of my favorites on the record.</p>
<p>A glaring omission in this album is any sort of Japanese lyrics - a big part of previous
KKB songs was the seemingly random switch between English and Japanese, but this album
is entirely in English. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessarily a bad thing, but was definitely
something I noticed right away.</p>
<p>As I mentioned previously, the songs are less obviously electro and dancy. There&rsquo;s more
acoustic drums, more guitar (even some heavier guitars on a few of the songs) and while
it&rsquo;s a pretty big sonic shift for the band, I think they pull it off really well. It&rsquo;s
pretty unique, and still has plenty of synth and electronic elements to it, so overall
I enjoyed the new style.</p>
<p>Overall I don&rsquo;t have a ton to say here - this record wasn&rsquo;t earth-shattering to me,
but I really enjoyed it and find myself wanting to include KKB in my regular music
rotation, so that&rsquo;s as glowing of a recommendation as I can give it. Some topics were
pretty serious, but overall it felt like a fun introspection on some pretty ordinary
moments in life, which is a songwriting style I really love.</p>
<p><strong>Score</strong>: 7/10</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Tracks</strong>: Only Acting, Flyway, Dear Future Self</p>
<p><strong>One Recommendation</strong>: Time Today</p>
