<h1>Hello! I am alive, and blogging again</h1>
<p>Hello! I haven&rsquo;t written anything on this website in a hot minute so it felt like time to do that.
It&rsquo;s very easy for me not to blog because I feel like I don&rsquo;t have anything interesting to post about,
so this is going to be a probably not-very-important blog post.</p>
<p>Some fun things happening in my day-to-day:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve become a bit of a sports guy lately. My local hockey team had a dissapointing season, but
I&rsquo;ve been enjoying football (aka soccer) and have season tickets for our local team. It&rsquo;s been great
to get really into the sport I played a lot as a kid. Makes me want to play again locally! There are some
casual adult leagues, which I&rsquo;ve been thinking about joining.</li>
<li>Been listening to lots of music, as usual. I have a Last.fm account I&rsquo;ve been updating regularly now,
so if you want to see what I&rsquo;ve been scrobbling (truly the silliest name of all time) you can look at
my profile <a href=https://www.last.fm/user/renodubois>here</a>.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been biking a lot more now that the weather has warmed up! I&rsquo;m only in office 2 days a week but have
mostly been biking to work on those two days. We&rsquo;re in the finishing stages of a protected bike lane
close to the soccer stadium, so I&rsquo;ve been monitoring progress of that, and using it when I can.</li>
<li>Also been playing lots of fighting games. Mostly the new <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2076010/UNDER_NIGHT_INBIRTH_II_SysCeles/>Under Night</a> game, but also trying to dabble with
other games - <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/520440/GUILTY_GEAR_Xrd_REV_2/>Guilty Gear Xrd</a>, and maybe trying a team game. Riot is working on their game 2XKO, which
seems very fun, but I haven&rsquo;t really played a team game, so I&rsquo;m thinking about trying <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/678950/DRAGON_BALL_FighterZ/>DBFZ</a>, <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/245170/Skullgirls_2nd_Encore/>Skullgirls</a>, or
maybe <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/357190/ULTIMATE_MARVEL_VS_CAPCOM_3/>Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a>, as we have some local players that like to play it.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been messing around with music making a bit also. Mostly electronic stuff - I&rsquo;m on a big dance music kick
at the moment. I&rsquo;ve also been making slow progress on trying to learn how to DJ also, which has been a good
experiment in trying to get better at identifying what music goes well together. It&rsquo;s easy to feel discouraged about
my progress here sometimes because I haven&rsquo;t finished songs or anything, but my short term goal is to just keep
making small things, and use that momentum & consistency to help make bigger ideas, like whole songs.</li>
</ul>
