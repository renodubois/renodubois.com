<h1>Album a Week 2023</h1>
<p>Wew, that whole &lsquo;album a day&rsquo; thing didn&rsquo;t pan out so well. Instead, we&rsquo;re trying an album a week this year.</p>
<p>The rules are simple: listening to a new album I haven&rsquo;t listened to before, posting some thoughts here. I&rsquo;m
going to keep things in one post this time, so check back here to see what new albums I&rsquo;ve been looking at.</p>
<h2 id=week-1-_five-seconds-flat_-by-lizzy-mcalpine-week-1>Week 1: <em>five seconds flat</em> by Lizzy McAlpine <a href=#week-1>#</a></h2>
<p>I had seen a few mentions of Lizzy McAlpine but hadn&rsquo;t payed much attention until I saw her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7odxBDg-7JE">Tiny Desk</a>.
I was really impressed, so I decided to check out her newest album and hot dang did this blow me away. Lovely voice,
really fun & emotional songwriting paired into one - it&rsquo;s got the right balance of angst to make me feel the young adult
heartbreak, but not so much that I get annoyed with it. Production is gorgeous too, and navigates really well between slow,
sad songs, and some more upbeat numbers on the record. Highly recommended. Her earlier album, <em>Give Me A Minute</em> was also really good,
and worth a listen.</p>
<p>FFO: Phoebe Bridgers, Billie Eilish (the slow stuff), Olivia Rodrigo</p>
<p>Listen: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/68L5xVV9wydotfDXEik7eD?si=Lnfu9GAYRS-RgbHAJ43Y_g">Spotify</a></p>
