<p>Due to a lack of a review yesterday, today we&rsquo;re listening to two albums
to make up for it. Today&rsquo;s first album was <em>PLATONICPLANET</em> from K O T O
(which also sometimes stylized KOTO, I&rsquo;m not sure which is correct) - this
album was a lot of fun. The best way I could describe it is chiptune J-Pop,
a combination that I thought was really interesting. It&rsquo;s a pretty short,
8 track album that&rsquo;s just full of catchy upbeat pop songs that happen to use
chiptune instrumentals in a lot of the productions.</p>
<p>I often find the chiptune sound a bit distracting - in my experience, it often
dominates everything in the songs that it&rsquo;s in, and I don&rsquo;t think the sounds
themselves are good enough to warrent that. I think this album did a great job
of maintaining a balance between some more &ldquo;modern&rdquo; productions (especially on
the drums and percussion) while still having that chiptune flair.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know Japanese (yet!) so I can&rsquo;t comment specifically on the lyrical content,
but I really liked the vocals. They sat in this perfect middle ground between
the drums and the often appearing sparkly higher register accents (sometimes
even following the vocal melody, which I really liked).</p>
<p>Overall, I don&rsquo;t have a ton to say about this album. It was a fun listen, and
I would definitely put it back on again, but it wasn&rsquo;t earth shattering or anything
for me. Probably a big part of that is not being able to understand the lyrics,
since that&rsquo;s a big factor for me in music I really enjoy, but maybe this is a good
reason for me to actually get off my ass and learn Japanese.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d recommend this album if you&rsquo;re looking for a feel good album that makes you want
to dance, as it does a great job of that.</p>
<p><strong>Score</strong>: 6.5/10</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Songs</strong>: SUITEI Sweetie, PLATONIC PLANET</p>
<p><strong>One Recommendation</strong>: SUITEI Sweetie (this song is a bop!)</p>
