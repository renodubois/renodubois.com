I haven&amp;rsquo;t written anything on this website in a hot minute so it felt like time to do that. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy for me not to blog because I feel like I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything interesting to post about, so this is going to be a probably not-very-important blog post.
Some fun things happening in my day-to-day:
I&amp;rsquo;ve become a bit of a sports guy lately. My local hockey team had a dissapointing season, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying football (aka soccer) and have season tickets for our local team.</description></item><item><title>Album a Week 2023</title><link>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/album-a-week-2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 12:42:52 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/album-a-week-2023/</guid><description>Wew, that whole &amp;lsquo;album a day&amp;rsquo; thing didn&amp;rsquo;t pan out so well. Instead, we&amp;rsquo;re trying an album a week this year.
The rules are simple: listening to a new album I haven&amp;rsquo;t listened to before, posting some thoughts here. I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep things in one post this time, so check back here to see what new albums I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at.
Week 1: five seconds flat by Lizzy McAlpine # I had seen a few mentions of Lizzy McAlpine but hadn&amp;rsquo;t payed much attention until I saw her Tiny Desk.</description></item><item><title>Alvvays: Antisocialites - Review</title><link>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/alvvays-antisocialites-review/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 21:37:49 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/alvvays-antisocialites-review/</guid><description>This is a review for my month long Album-a-Day adventure in Jan. 2022. if you want to read the other reviews, check out the original post.
Review number 2 today: the second album from Canadian band Alvvays, Antisocialites.
This was a suuuuuper cool album that combined a really cool voice, indie pop and the guitar tone of lighthearded shoegaze. As you might have guessed by the shoegaze record previously reviewed on this blog, I really loved it.</description></item><item><title>alt-J: An Awesome Wave - Review</title><link>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/alt-j-an-awesome-wave-review/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 21:07:50 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/alt-j-an-awesome-wave-review/</guid><description>This is a review for my month long Album-a-Day adventure in Jan. 2022. if you want to read the other reviews, check out the original post.
Like most folks in the mid 2010s, I heard Breezeblocks on my local alt rock radio station for the first time, and thought &amp;ldquo;what a weird but catchy song&amp;rdquo;. That theme was&amp;hellip;further explored in the rest of the album that Breezeblocks was on, An Awesome Wave.</description></item><item><title>Kevin Abstract: ARIZONA BABY - Review</title><link>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/kevin-abstract-arizona-baby-review/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 21:51:38 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/kevin-abstract-arizona-baby-review/</guid><description>This is a review for my month long Album-a-Day adventure in Jan. 2022. if you want to read the other reviews, check out the original post.
This is case for a few of the albums on my list this year, but I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I went this long without listening to Kevin Abstract&amp;rsquo;s latest album, ARIZONA BABY. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of both Kevin&amp;rsquo;s work in BROCKHAMPTON and also all things Jack Antonoff, and with the two of them coming together on this album is something I was sure to love.</description></item><item><title>K O T O: PLATONICPLANET - Review</title><link>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/koto-platonicplanet-review/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 13:15:52 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/koto-platonicplanet-review/</guid><description>This is a review for my month long Album-a-Day adventure in Jan. 2022. if you want to read the other reviews, check out the original post.
Due to a lack of a review yesterday, today we&amp;rsquo;re listening to two albums to make up for it. Today&amp;rsquo;s first album was PLATONICPLANET from K O T O (which also sometimes stylized KOTO, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure which is correct) - this album was a lot of fun.</description></item><item><title>Kero Kero Bonito: Time 'n' Place - Review</title><link>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/kkb-time-n-place-review/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 13:49:27 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/kkb-time-n-place-review/</guid><description>This is a review for my month long Album-a-Day adventure in Jan. 2022. if you want to read the other reviews, check out the original post.
Next up on the docket is Kero Kero Bonito&amp;rsquo;s Time &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; Place: a really nice, short album that tones down the bright and cheery electronic elements you heard in earlier KKB records and trades it in for guitars and the occasional bit of noise. I had only listened to a bit of KKB before this, and I was expecting more dancy electropop that I heard from them previously, but this album took a different direction that I really liked.</description></item><item><title>Black Country, New Road: For the first time - Review</title><link>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/bcnr-for-the-first-time-review/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/bcnr-for-the-first-time-review/</guid><description>This is a review for my month long Album-a-Day adventure in Jan. 2022. if you want to read the other reviews, check out the original post.
I realized as I started listening to this album that even though I saw their name on every music related thing for the past year, I had zero clue what the hell Black Country, New Road even sounded like. After listening to their debut record, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I can even articulate their sound well, but oh man was it amazing.</description></item><item><title>mikgazer vol 1 Review</title><link>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/mikgazer-vol-1-review/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 12:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/mikgazer-vol-1-review/</guid><description>This is a review for my month long Album-a-Day adventure in Jan. 2022. if you want to read the other reviews, check out the original post.
First album of the month is a compilation album, mikgazer vol. 1. This is a collection of shoegaze instrumentals with vocals by none other than everyone&amp;rsquo;s favorite vocaloid, Hatsune Miku. Part of the reason I picked this album was because of the odd pairing of those two things, but it honestly worked super well.</description></item><item><title>Album a Day Jan 2022</title><link>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/album-a-day-jan-2022-intro/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 00:01:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.renodubois.com/posts/album-a-day-jan-2022-intro/</guid><description>Howdy folks! No time to start posting things on the blog like the new year.
A friend recently suggested something I love the idea of - listening to an album you haven&amp;rsquo;t listened to before, every day for a month. I&amp;rsquo;m starting a few days late into January, but still excited to get started with this.
We&amp;rsquo;ll see how the frequency of these posts keeps up, but I&amp;rsquo;m planning on posting my thoughts on the albums I listen to here, so prepare for amateur music journalism.</description></item></channel></rss>
