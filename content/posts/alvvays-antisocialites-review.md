Review number 2 today: the second album from Canadian band Alvvays, _Antisocialites_.

This was a suuuuuper cool album that combined a really cool voice, indie pop and
the guitar tone of lighthearded shoegaze. As you might have guessed by the shoegaze
record previously reviewed on this blog, I really loved it. Everything was super
poppy and catchy, and fun to listen to, but with a bit of added noise and sparkles
on the guitar.

Some production highlights from the album: the guitar layers on _Not My Baby_,
the synth and outro in general in _Plimsoll Punks_, and just everything about
Forget About Life, which was a great album closer.

I'm gonna listen to this album (and I plan on also checking out their debut album)
so much this year, I just know it.


**Score**: 8.5/10

**Fav Tracks**: In Undertow, Dreams Tonite, Not My Baby, Forget About Life

**One Recommendation**: Not My Baby
