Wew, that whole 'album a day' thing didn't pan out so well. Instead, we're trying an album a week this year.

The rules are simple: listening to a new album I haven't listened to before, posting some thoughts here. I'm
going to keep things in one post this time, so check back here to see what new albums I've been looking at.

## Week 1: _five seconds flat_ by Lizzy McAlpine [#](#week-1)

I had seen a few mentions of Lizzy McAlpine but hadn't payed much attention until I saw her [Tiny Desk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7odxBDg-7JE).
I was really impressed, so I decided to check out her newest album and hot dang did this blow me away. Lovely voice,
really fun & emotional songwriting paired into one - it's got the right balance of angst to make me feel the young adult
heartbreak, but not so much that I get annoyed with it. Production is gorgeous too, and navigates really well between slow,
sad songs, and some more upbeat numbers on the record. Highly recommended. Her earlier album, _Give Me A Minute_ was also really good,
and worth a listen.

FFO: Phoebe Bridgers, Billie Eilish (the slow stuff), Olivia Rodrigo
