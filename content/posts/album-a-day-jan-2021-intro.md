Howdy folks! No time to start posting things on the blog like the new year.

A friend recently suggested something I love the idea of - listening to an
album you haven't listened to before, every day for a month. I'm starting a
few days late into January, but still excited to get started with this.

We'll see how the frequency of these posts keeps up, but I'm planning on
posting my thoughts on the albums I listen to here, so prepare for amateur
music journalism.

With that said, here's the list of albums I've got queued up, in no particular order:
