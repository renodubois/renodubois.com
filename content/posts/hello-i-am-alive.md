Hello! I haven't written anything on this website in a hot minute so it felt like time to do that.
It's very easy for me not to blog because I feel like I don't have anything interesting to post about,
so this is going to be a probably not-very-important blog post.

Some fun things happening in my day-to-day:
* I've become a bit of a sports guy lately. My local hockey team had a dissapointing season, but
    I've been enjoying football (aka soccer) and have season tickets for our local team. It's been great
    to get really into the sport I played a lot as a kid. Makes me want to play again locally! There are some
    casual adult leagues, which I've been thinking about joining.
* Been listening to lots of music, as usual. I have a Last.fm account I've been updating regularly now,
    so if you want to see what I've been scrobbling (truly the silliest name of all time) you can look at
    my profile [here](https://www.last.fm/user/renodubois).
* I've been biking a lot more now that the weather has warmed up! I'm only in office 2 days a week but have
    mostly been biking to work on those two days. We're in the finishing stages of a protected bike lane
    close to the soccer stadium, so I've been monitoring progress of that, and using it when I can.
* Also been playing lots of fighting games. Mostly the new [Under Night](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2076010/UNDER_NIGHT_INBIRTH_II_SysCeles/) game, but also trying to dabble with
    other games - [Guilty Gear Xrd](https://store.steampowered.com/app/520440/GUILTY_GEAR_Xrd_REV_2/), and maybe trying a team game. Riot is working on their game 2XKO, which
    seems very fun, but I haven't really played a team game, so I'm thinking about trying [DBFZ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/678950/DRAGON_BALL_FighterZ/), [Skullgirls](https://store.steampowered.com/app/245170/Skullgirls_2nd_Encore/), or
    maybe [Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/357190/ULTIMATE_MARVEL_VS_CAPCOM_3/), as we have some local players that like to play it. 
* I've been messing around with music making a bit also. Mostly electronic stuff - I'm on a big dance music kick
    at the moment. I've also been making slow progress on trying to learn how to DJ also, which has been a good
    experiment in trying to get better at identifying what music goes well together. It's easy to feel discouraged about
    my progress here sometimes because I haven't finished songs or anything, but my short term goal is to just keep
    making small things, and use that momentum & consistency to help make bigger ideas, like whole songs.
