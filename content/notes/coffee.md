title: 'Coffee'
---

This is an attempt to document some of the methods I use to brew myself coffee.

It's worth noting that (like many things) coffee is subject to a lot of personal
preference. Things I like doing may not be the best for you, so feel free to
adjust as needed.

I mostly drink filtered coffee, using a v60, with a preference towards lighter,
more acidic roasts. Almost all of the coffee I make at home I take black, but
I'll sometimes get oat milk with iced coffee at coffee shops.

## Gear (updated 2021 Jul)

I've provided links to these products on Amazon, but if possible, consider
purchasing from a local coffee shop to help support them!

If you have a good US-based distributor I can link to instead of Amazon,
feel free to [email me](mailto:me@renodubois.com) and I'll update these links.

- Brewer: [Hario v60, metal](https://www.amazon.com/Hario-Coffee-Dripper-Silver-VDM-02HSV/dp/B00BD1N8WC/)
- Kettle: [Bonavita Electric Gooseneck Kettle](https://www.amazon.com/Bonavita-BV382510V-Variable-Temperature-Gooseneck/dp/B005YR0F40/)
- Grinder: [Baratza Encore](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B007F183LK/)
- Carafé: [Hario Glass Server](https://www.amazon.com/Hario-Glass-Coffee-Server-1000ml/dp/B001V7NN1Y/) (there's a slightly smaller 600ml version by Hario that would also work well)
- Insulated Carafé: [Hario Double Walled Server](https://www.amazon.com/HARIO-VHS-60B-Double-Vacuum-Structure/dp/B071JDP87N/)
- Filters: [CAFEC Abaca Coffee Paper Filters](https://www.amazon.com/CAFEC-Cone-shaped-Universal-Disposable-Eco-Friendly/dp/B076MCYZ9R/)
- Scale: [Apexstone Kitchen Scale](https://www.amazon.com/Coffee-Scale-Waterproof-Scales-Espresso/dp/B07JG1PXLC/)
	- I'd recommend any scale that has 0.1g precision. A timer is nice too.
- Coffee Bean Storage: [Fellow Atmos Vacuum Canister (1.2L size)](https://fellowproducts.com/products/atmos-vacuum-canister)

Overall I'm pretty happy with my gear. The only upgrade I'd consider is a
nicer kettle, likely the [Fellow Stagg EKG](https://fellowproducts.com/products/staggekg), but it's not high on my list of
things to get.

## Beans

I use a variety of beans. If I buy locally I usually buy from these roasters:

- [Blueprint Coffee](https://blueprintcoffee.com/store/)
- [Sump Coffee](https://www.sumpcoffee.com/collections/whole-bean-coffee)
- [Coffeestamp](https://www.coffeestamp.com/collections/all)
- [Kaldi's Coffee](https://kaldiscoffee.com/collections/coffee)

I also have a [Trade](https://www.drinktrade.com/) subscription, which sends
me coffee from a variety of roasters. It's about the same cost as buying local,
which makes it a good way to try new beans easily. If you'd like to try it,
I have a [referral code](http://s.trdcfe.me/3qrdgP) that will get you a
discounted first bag, and gives me a small kickback. I'm not sponsored by Trade
or anything, I just like the service.

## Methods

For my v60, I generally use one of two methods:

- James Hoffman's Ultimate v60 Technique [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI4ynXzkSQo)
- Tetsu Kasuya's 4:6 Method [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCW8xSWGZY)

I'll make my own written versions of these at some point, but you can watch
those videos if you're interested. The 4:6 Method has started to be my go-to
in the mornings, it's really interesting and can be easily varied to make the
coffee taste quite different. If you're used to "normal" v60 methods, I'd
recommend giving it a try some time.
