Hey y'all, quick note from the editor on this one. Financial reports are...confusing to me as a non-financial person, so these notes aren't the greatest ones I've put out.
I'm hoping to understand more as I get through more meetings, but just a heads up that the first few financial meetings will be a bit harder for me to make useful notes for.
If you've got any suggestions on what information is actually useful here, or just any comments in general, just [let me know](mailto:me@renodubois.com)!

- Public comment: none for this meeting
- Bi-State Development Operating & Capital Budget
	- Presented by Tammy Fulbright
	- This is for the budget 2024-2026.
	- There are a bunch of figures and such that I can't easily share, but this information seems to all be in the [meeting packet](https://www.bistatedev.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/01272023-Audit-Finance-Administration-Committee-Open-Meeting-Materials-January-27-2023.pdf) that they provided.
	- Also, I really don't have a good grasp on a lot of budget things, so sorry in advance if I'm writing a bunch of things that don't make sense/aren't relevant!
	- Our 5-year average annual growth is 1.11%.
	- My favorite part of these budget presentations is that I forget that Bi-State runs the Arch - so you always get a financial statement of people hanging out at the arch.
	- If I'm reading this correctly, Metro is burning $77M a year. Yeesh.
		- That's after "depreciation and transfers", which may make that seem worse? Unclear.
	- Now talking about capital funds, which...is very confusing. There's some pie charts in the packet if you'd like to look at these allocations.
	- On to questions: and there are none.
	- Motion to approve, but this has to go to the full board for approval.
- Contract: Compensation Study
	- Diana Bentz is presenting here.
	- This is an annual review of compensation, and a formal review every 3 years.
	- They're proposing some changes to the system because it's hard to hire people right now, and they want to stay competitive in the market.
	- "multiple ranking technology" - lot of buzzwords here, holy wow. "management-driven vs consultant driven")
	- Anyways, this sounds like we're hiring a company to do this research. ~$200K.
	- Moore asks about the frequency of these reports: once a year for the internal, every 3 years they do a formal review, which is what this is.
	- Voice vote: it's passed.
- Internal Audit Follow-Up: Q2 FY2023
	- Next up, Crystal Messner is presenting this point and the next two.
- Internal Audit Status Report:
	- nothing to note here
- Internal Audit State Safety Oversight Status Report:
	- Everything was on schedule.
	- Roach chiming in here to say that some of the audits moving around is helping Bi-State target what they want to work on.
	- Lots of business-y jargon in this section. Apologies again for not having super useful notes!
	- Moore asks if the 12 incidents they found was more than usual: Messner says that she doesn't think it's indicative of a larger trend.
- Pension Evaluations Update
	- Every year, they get a firm to do an analysis on the pensions. Not too much to note here.
- Treasurer's Report
	- Talking about how much money Bi-State has in different portfolios.
	- As mentioned before, these details are in the meeting packet, so be sure to check that out if you want more details.
- Treasury Safekeeping Quarterly Accounts
	- Back to financial jargon.
- Financial Statements
	- This is going over the numbers we saw a bit earlier in the presentation.
- Procurement Report
	- Talking about more financials.
- Unscheduled Business: none
- CEO Report
	- Metro had a hiring event on Jan 28th.
- Nothing for the executive discussion.
- And adjourned!
